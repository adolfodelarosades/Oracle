# Prepare for 1Z0-149	 -  Prepare for Oracle Database 19c: Program with PL/SQL Certification 

### 1: Exam Overview

* Exam Overview - 10m

Hello and welcome to this overview on Preparing for the Programming with PL/SQL Certification Exam. Objectives on this one is what should you expect when you are getting ready to take the PL/SQL programming here certification. Well, our subject areas here are going to be the audience and prerequisites required, general exam information, the benefits that you'll get here from certification, a listing of the exam topics and areas that you can then turn to review and practice on, and then finally, the exam prep resources here that are available to you to prepare for your taking of the certification exam.

Well, the audience here that is intended for the certification exam would be PL/SQL developers, database administrators, and database developers. And our prerequisites certainly is the Oracle Database SQL. And that's the OCA here. That's Oracle Certified Associate. So you would need to have that examination as well.

Things to do before taking the exam? Well, certainly, the best way to prepare would be to follow the learning path of either the database-- I'm sorry, the Oracle Database SQL learning path or, certainly then, the Database 19 PL/SQL workshop. That would be a course.

Well, certainly, some would ask here, what are the benefits of having the Oracle Certified Professional, specifically in this case here, for PL/SQL? Well, one, you're going to be fully ready to exploit here the most advanced features appeals PL/SQL, specifically of course, for those here, for the Database 12c and 19c.

Also, that certification lets everybody know that you have been able to demonstrate the mastery of those skills. And of course that is prevalent here or easily demonstrated here by you receiving that certification.

The exam topics here-- and I'm just going to cover these somewhat briefly here. Major topics here. One is declaring PL/SQL variables. writing SQL in PL/SQL and working with composite data types, that's the first section. Key areas on this one-- certainly, you should be able to recognize here valid and invalid identifiers, maybe list and describe various data types using the percent type and a percent row type,

How to create user-defined PL/SQL records, how to create a record here using the percent road type attribute, how to initialize collections here in records. Certainly, create here executable blocks using DML. And that would be PL/SQL blocks.

Continue on here. Other topics are handling exceptions, creating procedures and parameters, and creating packages. Certainly, you will be assessed here on your knowledge of grading procedures with parameters, displaying and handling exceptions in procedures, how to remove and display procedural information from the system. What happens if you propagate exceptions? How do you define here PL/SQL exceptions? And identify the benefits and components of a package. And what does it take here to manage your packages, grading specifications, the body, and so forth?

Also, what does it take and what are the requirements here, or maybe the parameters here, for overloading a package subprograms? The exam will also cover using Dynamic SQL. And you'll need to do to be able to describe the execution flow of the SQL statements. And what is the use of Native Dynamic SQL? Be able to create compound DBL and event database triggers. Certainly, how to create a trigger on a DBL statement, creating triggers here on system events and so forth.

And how to manage your PL/SQL code. Certainly, understand how you can describe and use conditional compilation. What it takes here to whitelist code here. Your whitelist code access with the ACCESSIBLE BY clause. And mark code here is deprecated, among other things.

We'll also then turn the exam. You'll be examined on or evaluated on your understanding of writing executable statements. Certainly, identify lexical units in a PL/SQL block. Describe when implicit conversion takes place and when explicit conversion has to be dealt with. Writing control structures, understanding how to utilize here the construct and identify looping statements. When and the proper use of EXIT and CONTINUE statements inside of your loops.

And of course, explicit cursors. You'll be assessed on whether you can distinguish between an explicit and an implicit cursor. And also how to utilize here the current SQL cursor attributes. Understand how to declare and control explicit cursors using either simple loops or the cursor for loops to fetch information from the database. How to declare and use cursors with variables. I'm sorry, with parameters. And of course, how to lock rows with the FOR UPDATE and WHERE CURRENT row here with the WHERE CURRENT clause.

Using PL/SQL programs here, demonstrate your ability to differentiate between anonymous blocks and subprograms. Identify the benefits of subprograms. What it takes here to create functions and differentiate here between what a function is and what a procedure is. Describe the usage of functions. Where are they beneficial? How to create and use a polymorphic table function. And also, working with packages. We'll concentrate a little bit in that area here, using package types and variables. And of course, using package constants and functions in SQL.

Also understand here design considerations for PL/SQL code. How to write and call local subprograms. When and how to incorporate the use of the NO COPY hint, the PARALLEL ENABLE hint and DETERMINISTIC clause. Control runtime privileges of a subprogram. Use the PL/SQL compiler. Specifically of course here, with the later releases of PL/SQL, describe the new PL/SQL compiler and its features. And understand, of course, the compiler initialization parameters and also the new PL/SQL compile time warnings. Also manage dependencies. How can I track them and also then manage procedural dependencies?

And finally, here, the end. In conclusion here, exam prep resources. To prepare yourself here for the exam, of course, here, certainly, we would suggest here and highly recommend here that you proceed through the PL/SQL learning path. Specifically in that one would be to take the Oracle Database 19c PL/SQL workshop. And there's also, then, turn online reference here to the database PL/SQL program-- sorry, PL/SQL language reference. That's certainly available at docs.oracle.com.

In our next us section here, we're going to then turn, jump over here, and cover areas here where and how you should proceed in getting prepared here to take your certification examination.

### 2: Prepare for an Exam

* Exam Information 16m

In our next area we'd like to investigate in preparation for taking the certification exam, we'd like to give you a little-- I guess we'll call it guidance into how to prepare.

And our objectives, of course, here-- where can you glean exam information? Well, we do have a link here that's available for you to search on. And we'll go ahead and click on this and navigate into it, and show you the page.

Entering into this website is you scroll down here. Of course, it will give you the details. Much of it is what we showed you in the first section. As we go a little bit further in here, recommended training, or taking the exam, exam review topics.

If we step into that and look at the review topics, you'll see that these are the same headings that we investigated in the first section. Again, these will be areas that you can expect to have questions on within the examination. And our suggestion will be, of course, certainly to, then, investigate them all. And begin to identify where you feel comfortable and, of course, certainly then where you feel that you lack knowledge.

It would be not necessarily here to ignore any of these. I would consider looking at all of them and, in turn, maybe refreshing yourselves on things that you feel you understand very well and concentrating certainly more so on areas where you feel you are the weakest.

Let's get back to our slide deck. And coming into it here-- and, of course, when you step into these individual exam topics you can certainly review here and see what you recognize, what you do understand.

The next thing we would strongly suggest is to perform-- and this is where you need to be very realistic with yourself. The term I want to use here is don't minimize this, or don't take this lightly. Do an honest evaluation of your skills or your skill gap.

The first area, of course, that you would want to concentrate on in looking at this one here is an assessment of your skills. And in this case here, look. What do you think you know well? And, if you think about it, what do you do regularly within the current release for PL/SQL? Do you gather user requirements? Are you very abreast on PL/SQL tuning? How do you feel on designing your PL/SQL applications and so forth?

The next area, of course, is what have you done many times in the past. Also understand here, not in the current release but things that you know that have not changed. So, again, do be honest with yourself, and don't sugarcoat or take any topic lightly.

Then, of course, in performing the skills analysis gap, do understand you should brush up-- or not necessarily brush up, but identify items or concepts that you need to brush up on. You've done them before. You're aware of what's going on. But maybe it's still not as robust as you'd like. So, while you've done it in the past, you haven't done it recently.

This is a good example we show you here. Gosh, you used to write stored procedures all the time and work with cursors, but now the subordinates or junior developers are doing that for you. Or there are concepts that you found very difficult to understand, and you always had to maybe refer to documentation to round out or complete your task. These would be the areas, certainly, that you would want to brush up on. And certainly leave time in your study plan for these skill areas. Again, we should understand that you may have done this in the past, but it never hurts to revisit the technology.

Also, then, in your gap analysis, you would look at these are things that you do know but once again to brush up. Also, you do things regularly here, and it's all the same concept, but it's on an older release. And, of course, you may find yourself that you're still on the 12c release. And you're not aware of all of the new features that are coming in the new release.

Certainly examine your SQL and PL/SQL section in the New Features of the documentation. And, of course, we give you the links here, or give you listings here of these links to navigate to for these specific releases. And again, scope the extent of what has changed and do become very familiar with it.

Then, the other thing that you need to understand, you do occasionally do these things, but not regularly. And a good example is you used to use autonomous triggers in PL/SQL, but maybe you don't know all of the options. Maybe you're doing it just for a specific case.

Finally, in your gap analysis, hopefully, you have gone into the situation where you've discovered this is where you don't have very much knowledge at all. This is not something to be-- I can't even say ashamed of here or to look down on yourself is, just understand that while there's a lot of things that you can do in PL/SQL, you don't necessarily do everything all at once, or you cover all of the capabilities of PL/SQL.

So, again, you did it once when you took your course or the courseware-- which an example, and this is results cached functions-- but you don't necessarily work with that all of the time or on a repetitive basis. Again, it's a situation you really want to then, in turn, also take the time to brush up on it.

A good example of doing this when performing your evaluation is to generate a spreadsheet and list the topic areas that are going to be on the exam. And then perform your analysis there. And, of course, as you list the various components here, again, with an honest try to evaluation of your skills, your place here. How do you feel? What's your comfort level? Do you know it here? Maybe not as clear as you'd like.

And then from this evaluation, certainly what you'll do is you'll allocate appropriate time to determine where your time to concentrate on brushing up your skills or preparing yourself for the examination that's coming. This is where you're going to spend the majority of your time.

Certainly then, take it here and, as you're working through these, there's no harm in color-coding here because then you'll see that, all right, all the red areas here, you want to then, in turn, concentrate on, and understand, and get very comfortable with the concept to where you can then comfortably-- and again, in an honest evaluation here-- switch it over from a red area to, say, a green.

Other areas, of course, is where, yeah I'm knowledgeable of it, but maybe not as comfortable as I am with-- and certainly just declaring an anonymous block and working with code in that sense. Again, ideally, you should have the majority of your skills or the topics that would be in the green, or that is known to you. But certainly, don't ignore any areas. Concentrate on where you know that you're lacking as the depth of your skills is that you would think you would need.

So, create a study plan. And that's the reason why we point back here to establishing a spreadsheet, and then, in turn, listing the concepts, or the topics. And understand this is where I need to concentrate my studies, or I need to spend time in those areas.

And, of course, we tell you here, spend most of the time on "not know much at all." But I guess my concern on that one would be this is not to do all of your time on that. Certainly, definitely spend time on the subjects that you know but need to brush up on. But don't-- and I stress this one here more than anything else-- don't ignore the concepts that you are comfortable with because one of the things is that because you do it every day, you may get complacent. And you don't want to go into the examination with some overconfidence, because if you go in there with that mindset, as soon as you get surprised with an area that possibly you didn't concentrate on, then there goes your confidence level.

Certainly candidates do much better on advanced topics than on basic ones because you ignore the commonplace and tend to concentrate on things that are more difficult. If possible, and I would highly recommend it, have a sandbox environment to practice. Definitely repetition.

And my personal opinion in working with code, if you haven't been coding in a while or you don't code as heavily as you used to, it's kind of like a muscle. If you don't exercise it, it tends to atrophy a little bit. So you would want to certainly then, in turn, understand with some hands-on practice the concept or the areas that you might need to concentrate on.

And certainly some features require an environment to fully learn their behavior. And this may be even more important if you're working on an older release or you're going to be testing on a release that you're going to be moving to and you want to get certification with that already, then it's good to practice on the most current release.

Certainly, of course, common obstacles in the success of accomplishing the successful completion of the certification examination, the biggest one is overconfidence. Definitely, you still need to prepare. And you should prepare even for items that you feel that you know very well. Prepare for some scenario-type exams.

The biggest thing that we need to understand is that the testing is not going to be memorization and regurgitation. There are going to be questions that require that you know the concept well enough to distinguish between-- in a multiple choice-type situation-- to where two answers may be but which is the best answer. And that's what the examination will be looking for.

The scenario-type exams, these are situations that will require a solution. And some may seem the same. But, of course, understand that it will, unless directed as such, it resolves down to just a single answer. And just logically trying to deduce the correct answer may not necessarily be-- you may not be able to do.

Prepare on the current release, the release of the examination that you're taking. And again, the one that we're outlining in this one here is for the 19C PL/SQL Certified Professional. Understand that features do change, and also, some features get deprecated or obsoleted. So what you did know here is not pertinent, possibly, in the current release.

Also, preparation. How deeply should you know your technology? Testing is definitely not on recognition and not recall. So, really, it is not rote memorization. They're striving here to make sure that you understand not only the concepts, but are you able to also implement. So the testing is on the concepts, why do we do it this way here, or why is it done this way here. What's the purpose of it? And, of course, what are the components of a certain process or a certain procedural step.

And the testing will also be on implementation. So, it's good to know and, in turn, play with this nicely, to understand that when you prepare, do prepare. It's not going to be multiple guess and you can logically eliminate one or most answers and then be able to deduce. No, it's going to be certainly a test that's going to require that you have good understanding of the concepts and be able to delineate between similar possibilities the best correct answer.

As we'll continue in our seminar in preparation for the certification exam, we're going to take you in the next section, show you some sample questions that you would be receiving in the certification exam.

### 3: How to Approach Questions

* sample Questions - 18m

And as we continue in this exam preparation guide, what we're going to do, of course, is now, as promised, to take you through some sample questions. Before we do that, though, let's look at some survival skills here for successful completion of the exam. First and foremost here, flag for review is an ability that you'll have here too if you get stuck on an item here to go back and review it for later. In other words, don't dwell on it here and burn up a lot of time here if you're stuck on something. Flag it for review and come back to it here towards the end.

If an item also contains here two or more options here that are alternatives, then do understand here, none of them might be true. Some might be true. And all might be true. So reading here the question would be tantamount here to making sure you understand what the correct best answer or answers may be.

Do understand that in this examination here, you will be unable to answer items by using a logical deduction alone. In some cases here, we've seen multiple guess-- or multiple choice questions here, you can logically deduce it down to the correct answer. In our situation here, or least our desire for the examination, is to make it meaningful. And hence, then, our questions here in the examination will not then lend itself here to just using logical deduction alone.

And of course, your exam items are going to be of both the learner's style here and the practitioner style. Learner style, of course, I would qualify that one here is saying that is more on concepts and understanding here limitations. Practitioner style would be looking at some code here and determining here whether or not here you're going to have it run successfully, what the results would be of the successful run, or if you were going to receive errors, what type of errors might they be.

So as promised here, let's go and look at some of our sample questions. The first one you're looking at here says, which two are true about statement level triggers? And you'll note here there are numerous choices on here. I'm going to sit here for a second and let you mark down as you're working through this slide here the possible correct answers.

And you'll note here, there are two on this one here. Now, I've noted mine here. Again, we'll come back here to these as we navigate through this slide here.

The next question here, looking at those one, we want you to examine this declaration section. And in looking at this one here, which line here is going to then, in turn, return a compilation error? And of those choices, again, I'll have you note these. And we will come back here and examine our answers here again at the end of this session.

Third question here, again, we want you to examine this declaration section. And then having reviewed that, which line in this one here will terminate here with a compilation error? Again, looking at these values here-- or I'm sorry, looking at the declaration section, review it here. Make your choice. And we will review it again here at the end of this session.

Sample question number four, examine this command here that executes successfully. And of course, we see that it is a simple creating table statement here in SQL. Now let's examine the code here that gets executed. Knowing that it's an anonymous block here, we're declaring right here, see our values within this. And as we've looked at this one here fairly well, I'm going to give you just a little bit more time on this one, because we need to navigate to another page here to continue with this question.

And so now, so which is true about the result? And I can toggle back for you again as well. Understand here, our first choice on this one, it returns an error, because the value is not provided for salary or a value is not provided for a salary. It returns an error because the value is longer than a column width. It inserts null into ID, King into name here, and salary into-- and, I'm sorry, 2,500 into salary. Or it inserts specific values into-- I'm sorry, specified values into ID, and, name and 2,500 into salary.

And looking back at our statement, And I'll let you look at the answers again, possible choices, and let you proceed on this one. And going to the fifth question, which two statements down below here are true about triggers in an Oracle database? And once more here, check your answers. Or write down your answers. And we will continue on.

Question number six here, which two are true about the others clause in exception blocks? And the final one that we have, let's examine our code blocks here that execute successfully. So you'll see this one is to create replace procedure log log_usage. And we've got p_card_id number and p-- comma, I'm sorry, and p_loc number is.

And then we have pragma autonomous transaction. And then we can begin insert into usage, values. And of course, it's the p_card_id and p_loc and log_usage. And then create a replace procedure bank_trans.

And p_cardnbr is number, and comma p_loc number is. And we're going to then do an insert into trans or tnx, right-- I'm sorry, txn values, and 9,001 and 1,000. And then we're making a call to log_usage, and p_card_number, and p_loc. All right, there is our code.

Then in turn, now examine this execute which returns an error. So we're executing bank_trans passing in parameters of 50 and 2,000. And we want to know here, why does the error occur? And as you answer that question, we will now then turn, reveal the answers.

Now, yeah, let's go back to-- well, no, I'll just reveal the answers. And then you can self-evaluate yourselves. Then we'll go back here and explain. So the answers for number one was A and D. Keep that one in mind, because I'll go back here to the question and evaluate it.

For question number two, it was C. Question number three is B. Question number four is B. Question number five is B and C. Question number six is B and E. And question number seven is D.

All right, so if we go back here to our first one, so in this one here, which two are true about the statement level triggers? And the answer on this one, again, if you remember correctly, was A and D. So they are executed each time here in the triggering statement-- each time the triggering statement is executed and must be autonomous to run transaction control language statements. Both of these would be classified as learners style.

Continuing to two here, sample question number two, and this one here, of course, is, which line here returned a compilation error? Well, in this one, of course, we see that, of course, it's line number four. So and the answer is C on this one. And again, remembering here-- and again, learns style here, if you declare a variable here as being not null, you need to initialize it as well.

Question number three, we're looking at him examining the declaration section. And once again here, and looking at this one, which line will terminate here with a compilation error? And this one sometimes is a little tricky. But the correct answer on this one is B, line number three. And this can catch you guys here.

You'll note here that the declaration, of course, is v_startdate. And we wanted to assign the value of sysdate, but we were missing the colon, so colon equal, so instead of just equal. And that's the reason why we get the error on that one.

And sample question number four, we're looking at this one. We see that the first command here executes successfully. Now when we look at the code here, which gets executed, in turn, you'll note here we're going to then turn, see this one. And the question was, which is true about the result?

And of course the true is that it returns an error because the value is longer than the column width. And if we go back and look at our example, you'll see that. And this one's kind of scary. This is that we've got v_id here. It's VARCHAR2.

We know that the table right here in and of itself here would only accept three characters for ID. That's what we're going to be stuffing into it here, because you'll note we're inserting into emp. And the id and the name columns, that was v_id and v_name, difficult to see again here.

And again, this is just noting detail. You'll note there is actually four characters right here, four spaces that are going into a field here that can only accept three. Hence, there is the reason why that one fails.

All right, question number five, looking at this one, which two are true about triggers in an Oracle database? And of course, we can recognize on this one here that the correct answers were B and C. They can call sub programs written in Java. And they can call stored procedures.

All right, there is some truth to a maximum size, but 64 kilobytes is not correct. Also you can't-- we could have eliminated here, this is knowledge that you should know. F and G here are false, because the correlation names here for long and long raw columns are not available.

All right, going to question number six, which two are true about the others clause and the exceptions block. Or I refer to it as the exceptions section in your PLSQL code. And the correct answer on this one, of course, was D and E. And again, the only code it wants in an exception block, and it must be the last exception handling clause. Again, I would classify this one as learner style.

And finally, the last one we're looking at, we wanted you to examine the code here that executes successfully. And our question on this one was, when we execute bank_transaction at 50 and 2,000, why does the error occur? And the correct answer on this one is D here, because the autonomous transactions must have either a commit or a rollback statement in its code block. And if we go back and look at this one, we are missing that. There is no ending of this transaction for the autonomous transaction.

All right, that takes you here to-- and those are our answers. This is what you will-- a very good example of what you can expect here in your certification exam. For my personal, I guess, statement on this one, what I would tell you here is is to, one, certainly exercise your knowledge.

Be confident in your skills here. But and probably more so-- and if I go back here to the example that we showed you, the code, and where the error occurred, and that one actually was question number four. If we go back and look at that one here real quick, you'll note on this one here, the code here, of course, it looks very simple.

And if you go very quickly here, you will ignore here that there is that space in between. And of course, then there is a character string of a length of four here, where it can only go into three. So that can catch you.

If you go back even a little bit further in our declaration, on question number three, that colon equal, that can catch you as well. So again, coming back here to our answers, you'll see that it's not necessarily how quickly you can get through this one. We don't want you to rush through your questions, but don't dawdle, either. Understand here that the questions here need to be reviewed, need to be read fully here. And then certainly, take the time to evaluate. Hopefully you will find that this has been beneficial here in getting you prepared here for your examination.

### 4: Oracle Certification Program Resources

* Taking your Exam Online - 10m

Hello there. You've signed up for an Oracle certification. Congratulations. In the next few minutes, you will see what to expect when you start the process of taking your exam online and how you can prepare yourself for it.

In this video you will be guided through the steps you will need to perform before you can take your exam online. We will start with the points you need to remember as you prepare your exam environment to comply with exam regulations. You will be guided through the process of accessing your exam through CertView and the OnVUE application, where you will perform system checks and go through the check-in process. You will also be provided links to contact technical support if you require.

First you must find a quiet location with no other people present. Clear your desk of any peripheral devices, secondary monitors, writing material, or any other material that is not required for the exam. We recommend having only your computer, mouse, and charger-- in case of a laptop-- on your desk. Remove all writable surfaces, like books, calendars, and whiteboards from your room where you are taking your exam.

When testing your system prior to the day of the exam, make sure to run that system test on the same computer and network that you will use on the day of the exam. Make sure you have administrative rights on the computer to download and install the required online proctoring software.

Here are some technical specifications that your system should meet before the exam. The recommended operating systems are Windows 10, Windows 8.1, Windows 7, Mac OS 10.9 or higher. The minimum screen resolution is 1024 by 768. If your display supports a higher resolution, it's much better.

You will need a sustained high-speed internet connection for the duration of the exam. Make sure you have a strong internet connection with a speed of 3 Mbps down and 2 Mbps up. Do not use a mobile hotspot.

Supported internet browsers at Internet Explorer 11, Chrome, Firefox, and Safari. We recommend the latest version. Use a laptop with a working webcam and an inbuilt microphone. No external headsets or microphones are permitted. Make sure cookies are enabled in your browser and pop-up blockers are disabled.

Disable any VPN connection on your computer and make sure you are not taking this exam behind a company firewall. Also disable virus check software, such as McAfee, since it might slow down your system while taking the exam. Check your system tray or task manager, and make sure you shut down non-essential software. On Windows 10, you can find the system tray at the bottom right of the screen.

Some examples of software that can cause a system check to fail, and which you should avoid running at the time of the system test and exam, are chat software, such as Slack or Jabber; remote access software, such as VNC Server or any other software that allows remote access to your system; any screen capture or recording software, such as Greenshot, Snagit, or Tiny Take; and any non-essential software you see running in the system tray, such as WebEx or printer software.

Make sure all your system checks have passed. And do not proceed if a system check failed. In case you run into issues with the system check, use the Pearson VUE Live Chat option.

Please have your required ID proof handy. You won't be able to take the exam without it. Examples of valid ID proof are a driver's license or a passport.

On the day of your exam, you want to make sure you are ready to take the exam without a hitch. Here's what you need to do. In Step 1, go to your appointment mail, where you will find a link to the Pearson VUE page. Navigate to this page and click on Log In. This will take you to the Oracle CertView login page, where you can perform the second step, which is logging in using your CertView account.

When prompted, enter your Oracle SSO login credentials. You will see your Pearson VUE dashboard, where your upcoming and completed exams are listed. Click on the exam to move to the next step, Beginning Your Exam.

At Step 3, you are ready to begin your exam. The Begin Exam button will be available 30 minutes before your exam start time. Click this button to begin your exam.

You have already tested your computer and internet when you registered for this exam. In Step 4, you will be required to re-test whether your system is ready for the actual exam. Copy the access code, which is required later to verify your identification details using your phone. Click on Download and save the OnVUE dot exe file on your system. Please be patient, as the OnVUE dot exe file is downloaded to your system.

Run the downloaded OnVUE dot exe file. You will then enter the access code you had copied before and your phone number. Your phone number will be used to contact you if there is any issue with the check-in process.

After providing your code and phone number, click on Get Started to begin the check-in process. Step 5 involves a system check, where your microphone, internet speed, and webcam functionality is tested. Please speak into your microphone while the microphone test is happening, or the microphone test may fail. Click on Next once the test passes.

In Step 6, you will perform the check-in process, which involves multiple tasks. You will first need to share photos of yourself, your identification documents, such as a driver's license or passport, and photos of your surrounding workspace. You have two options to take these photos. You can use your mobile phone or your webcam. If you wish to use your mobile phone, please enter your contact information after selecting the preferred access method, else click on Use your Webcam.

* How to access your exam results - 5m

Welcome to this video on how to access your exam results and certification credentials in CertView. We will start with logging into CertView, go through the steps to view your exam results, and also learn how to manage your certification credentials. To log in to CertView, go to education.oracle.com, point to Certification, and click CertView. Alternatively, you can directly visit certview.oracle.com, and log in using your Oracle login ID and password.

This is your CertView homepage. You'll see a navigation menu on the left and important notes about the new CertView portal in the main window. To view your results, click the Results option on the left navigation menu. The first two options here are related to your exam results.

Click the Latest Pearson VUE Exam Results to see the score report of the latest exam that you have taken. Your score report shows your score, the result-- pass or fail-- and provides feedback about your performance. This score report is available to you immediately after you complete the exam with Pearson VUE.

Click Pearson VUE Results History to see all of the historical data of the exams that you have taken so far. You can open the score reports of all of these exams from here as well.

Now let's see how you can view the details of all of the certifications that you have earned so far. Click Credential Management on the left navigation menu. Under that, choose Review Certification History. Credentials appear here within 48 hours after passing the exam at Pearson VUE. If you do not see your credentials here, it could be due to the following reasons. One, you've not allowed 48 hours for your certification to be processed.

Two, you have not completed all of the requirements for the certification track. There are some Oracle certifications which required you to pass more than one exam, for example, the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure 2020 Certified Architect Professional certification. This requires you to have already achieved Oracle Cloud Infrastructure 2020 Architect Associate certification, and you should have passed Oracle Cloud Infrastructure 2020 Architect Professional 1Z0-997-20 exam.

The third reason why a credential may not show up here is that you've taken the contributing exams under different testing IDs. In that case, you can click My Account and use the option Request to Merge Accounts to submit a request to merge your multiple testing IDs.

Open any certification credential to expand it. Here, you'll see the status of your credential as active or inactive, the date that you achieved it. You have an option here to claim your digital badge. You can also share this digital badge on social media from here. There's also an option to download your e-certificate. Alternatively, you can claim or share your digital badge, download your e-certificate, publish your credentials to third parties using the Credential Management option from the left navigation menu.

If you have any further questions on how to view your results and credential details in CertView, you can contact the Oracle Certification Program Customer Support team from education.oracle.com, Certification, Contact Oracle Certification Support link. Hope this video was useful, and thanks for watching.
